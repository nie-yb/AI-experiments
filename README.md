# Diagnosing Forecast Error Propagation and Large-Scale Dynamics of Weather Extremes with an AI Weather Model
This repository contains the scripts that generate the main results presented in the manuscript entitled **Diagnosing Forecast Error Propagation and Large-Scale Dynamics of Weather Extremes with an AI Weather Model**. Provided code covers data preparation, GraphCast model inference, physical diagnosis, and visualization. The following are the specific contents of each folder:

* data_preparation: Scripts that download ERA5 data, generate the adjusted climatology for climatology constraint (CC) experiments, and convert them into a structure usable by GraphCast.
* graphcast: A modified rollout.py script to replace the script in the GraphCast source code for constrained experiments.
* inference: Scripts to generate free or constrained predictions using GraphCast.
* diagnosis: Scripts to calculate apparent heat source (Q1).
* figures: Scripts that generate main figures in the manuscript.
* utils: Some auxiliary functions.
